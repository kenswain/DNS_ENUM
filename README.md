# DNS_ENUM
I have always wanted to play around with writing a DNS Enumeration tool. These are those humble beginnings. I am going to use this as my playground for now. Might actually make this a real tool sometimes in the near future. 

## Current Useage

dnslookup.py -a to get a hostname from an address
dnslookup.py -d to get an address from a hostname
